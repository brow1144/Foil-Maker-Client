## About Foil Maker 
  Foil Maker is a spin off of the mobile game pysch. It is the client side of the project. At the start, both the users create accounts and login to the server. Then one player starts the game and the other joins with a 3 digit code. Once all the players have joined the leader presses that start game button which switches all the clients in the game to the first phrase. All the users input a phrase that they think is the closest answer. Then once everyone has subitted, all the opitions plus the correct answer are showed to everyone. They all try to pick the correct answer. After they all submit, the server calculates the scores and shows the current scoreboard. Then it repeats until the deck is empty.
